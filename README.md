# Monte-Carlo Simulations

## Introduction
Simulating random variables from complex probability distributions is a fundamental task in scientific computing. This project implements two widely used simulation techniques: the **Accept-Reject Method** and the **Markov Chain Monte Carlo** simulation. These methods enable sampling from non-standard or high-dimensional distributions that are challenging to simulate directly.
